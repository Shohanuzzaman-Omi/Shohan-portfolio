        <p>I'm Shohanuzzaman Omi. I'm a designer who codes. I'm a web designer. I've worked internationally, in-house, and remotely on projects for leading brands, agencies, startups, and charities. I care deeply about creating world-class, useful, and beautiful Websites that help people and make a difference. I can be as involved in your project as you need me to be; from the seed of the idea to sketches, creative direction, design, and copywriting.</p>
